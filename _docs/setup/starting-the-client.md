Starting the client is fairly simple...

* Open a command prompt or powershell prompt
* Navigate to the client directory
* Type `python "Decision Descent.py"`

The above assumes you're using the system interpreter.
If you're not using the system interpreter, you need to change `python` to
your interpreter's full path (`"C:/Program Files/Python/python.exe"`).
