# What is Decision Descent?

Decision Descent is a mod for [The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+](https://store.steampowered.com/app/570660/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Afterbirth/)
that allows stream chat to influence the game.

# Installation

* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/sirrandoo/decision-descent/releases)
* The zip should contain a `mod` folder, and a `client` folder.
* The `mod` folder should go in your Afterbirth+ [mods directory](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.com/Modding_(Afterbirth_%E2%80%A0)#Manual_installation)
* The `client` folder should go in [ShovelBot](https://github.com/sirrandoo/shovelbot)'s extension's directory.
* Enable Decision Descent in Isaac's mod list, and enjoy.

Should go without saying, but you *do* need to have ShovelBot running while you're using the mod.
